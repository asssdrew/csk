        <br>MS Dhoni the man or we should call him a leader. When there's ICC Cricket World Cup became a dream to every Indian Cricket Fans then this Man the Leader the Legend won the ICC Cricket Worrld Cup 2011 after 28 years. The legend MS Dhoni who already has won a ICC t20 World Cup has now won another ICC trophy as ICC Cricket World Cup now there's only one ICC trophy left to win and that is ICC Champion Trophy. In 2013 its time, When MS Dhoni won the ICC Champions Trophy 2013 against England in their home England. None other Captian ever won all the ICC Trophies then, MS Dhoni is the only captian in the world who have won all the ICC Trophies. <br> MS Dhoni is same person who is leading the CSK since 2008 IPL and even he is the only captian to still leading CSK since 2008.CSK is the most Successful IPL tema in the IPL history.<br> However last year on Independance Day MS Dhoni retired from all formates of the Cricket expect IPL, all the MS fans were emotional that day. Offcourse we won't see MS in Blue jersey again on the field but would watch him in yellow for CSK. In 2020 IPL had to be started in September due to Covid-19  which is a global pandemic. The Tournamant started and frist match was CSK vs MI and CSK started well with a winning game but afer that game everything gone in wrong direction . CSK lost one afeter one game in 2020 season and at end CSK ended the season on no. 7 position which was happened first time in IPL history. Yes 2020 was a worst year for MS Dhoi's fan. CSK has to start again with a new thinking in next year.</p2>
